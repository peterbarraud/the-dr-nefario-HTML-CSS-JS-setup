# The Dr. Nefario HTML/CSS/JS setup
(Why?. Because I love that scene in `Despicable me` where `Dr. Nefario` packs all his stuff in one little suitcase and leaves)

(No Bootstrap - just plain ol JS and CSS (or SASS))

(Preferably run the steps 1 to 3 in `Git bash`)
1. Clone this repo
1. cd into the resultant folder
1. Install the npm dependencies using `npm i`

# How to use
## Modal
Create a `dialog` element (with class="modal-dialog") on your HTML with the following mandatory components:
* modal-header: Only plain text as header (formatting we manage)
* modal-body: All html/text within this is your responsibility. Anything allowed with the [HTML dialog component](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/dialog) is allowed here.
* modal-footer: Footer should contain the buttons to do what you want. You can put any buttons that you want. They will all be right-alligned
